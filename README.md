# Shape-Classification

The project aims at identifying the shape of the targets segmented from aerial images. 

The aerial images are captured using a smartphone mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and the targets are segmented from these images using a saliency based approach.

Following is one of the aerial images captured during test flights
